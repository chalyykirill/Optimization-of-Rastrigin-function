# Optimization of Rastrigin function
## Project Description
This project is an academic work performed in a Jupyter Notebook using the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to explore and compare the effectiveness of different optimization algorithms for finding the minimum of the Rastrigin function, one of the classic test functions for optimization algorithms.

## Included Algorithms
- Newton's Method: A classical optimization method that uses gradients and Hessians to find function extrema.
- Genetic Algorithm: An evolutionary algorithm that simulates the process of natural selection and genetic inheritance.
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): An algorithm inspired by the social behavior of animals such as fish and birds.
- Bee Algorithm: An optimization algorithm that models the behavior of bees in searching for food.
